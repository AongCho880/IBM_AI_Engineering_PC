# 🎓 1️⃣ Academic / Thesis-Level Prompt (Research-Oriented)

> Provide a comprehensive, academically rigorous explanation of the Transformer architecture and its components, including Encoder, Decoder, Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, Positional Encoding, Layer Normalization, Residual Connections, and Feed-Forward Networks.
>
> The explanation should:
>
> * Include formal definitions and mathematical formulations (e.g., attention equation, scaled dot-product attention)
> * Clearly explain the differences between Encoder-only, Decoder-only, and Encoder–Decoder architectures
> * Discuss representative models such as BERT, GPT, and T5 in architectural context
> * Include well-labeled architectural diagrams illustrating data flow
> * Provide comparison tables of model types, strengths, and limitations
> * Explain training objectives (MLM, CLM, Seq2Seq loss)
> * Discuss computational complexity (O(n²) attention)
> * Highlight advantages over RNNs and CNN-based sequence models
> * Include real-world NLP applications (QA, summarization, machine translation)
>
> The explanation should follow a structured academic style suitable for inclusion in a Master's thesis literature review section, using precise terminology and logical flow.

# 💼 2️⃣ Interview Preparation Style Prompt (Concept + Depth)

> Explain the Transformer architecture in a clear but technically strong way suitable for machine learning interviews.
>
> The explanation should:
>
> * Start with the motivation (limitations of RNNs/LSTMs)
> * Clearly explain Self-Attention with intuition and formula
> * Explain Encoder vs Decoder vs Encoder–Decoder architectures
> * Compare BERT, GPT, and T5 in simple terms
> * Include step-by-step explanation of how input text is processed
> * Include diagrams to visualize the architecture
> * Provide common interview questions and strong sample answers
> * Discuss time complexity and why attention is O(n²)
> * Explain when to choose each architecture in practice
>
> Keep the explanation structured, conceptually clear, and technically solid, focusing on building deep understanding rather than memorized definitions.
